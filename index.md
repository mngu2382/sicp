My attempt at
[The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).
Includes summary notes, solutions to exercises and related sundry.
Pieces of code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mngu2382/sicp).

The notes quote heavily from the original text, but the solutions are
my own, and where I have use the solutions of others as hints I've
included a reference.

While the html version of the book maybe sufficient, there is also a
beautifully typeset pdf version of the book (base on the html).
