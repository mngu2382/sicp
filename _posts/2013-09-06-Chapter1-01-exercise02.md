#### Exercise 1.9
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two
positive integers in terms of the procedure `inc`, which
increments its arguments by 1, and `dec`, which decrements is
arguments by 1.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
{% endhighlight %}
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or
recursive?

##### Solution

The first procedure evolves the following recursive process

{% highlight scheme %}
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
; 9
{% endhighlight %}

The second procedure evolves the following iterative process

{% highlight scheme %}
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
; 9
{% endhighlight %}

#### Exercise 1.10
The following procedure computes a mathematical function called
Ackermann's function.

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (A x y)
    (cond ((= y 0) 0)
          ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
          ((= y 1) 2)
          (else (A (- x 1)
                   (A x (- y 1))))))
{% endhighlight %}
What are the values of the following expressions?

{% highlight scheme %}
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
{% endhighlight %}

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
{% endhighlight %}
Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed
by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive
integer values of $n$ . For example, `(k n)` computes $5n^2$.

##### Solution
From the definition of `A`, `(f n)` is clearly $2n$.

{% highlight scheme %}
(A 1 10)
(A 0 (A 1 9))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
...
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
...
(A 0 512)
; 1024
{% endhighlight %}
From the evolution of this process we see that `(g n)` results in
$2^n$

{% highlight scheme %}
(A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2))
(A 1 (A 1 4))
(A 1 16)
; 65536
{% endhighlight %}
From the evolution of this process we see that `(h n)` results in

$$
\underbrace{2^{2^{2^{\ldots^{2}}}}}_{\text{$n$ times}}
$$
