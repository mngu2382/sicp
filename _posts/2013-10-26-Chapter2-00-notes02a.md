To implement the painters in the picture language we use
[Script-Fu](http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-using-script-fu-tutorial.html),
which is a Scheme scripting console that is available in
[Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/). The implementation is by no means
complete, with the omission of the `segements->painter` procedure and
restrictions on the frames that the painters can accept as arguments
the two main issues.

### Restricted frames

The frames that painters can accept have been restricted so as to make
the implementation of painters easier while still being able to be
manipulated by higher-order procedures such as `square-limit`.

Frames accepted by painters must

- have edges orthogonal to each other; and
- be square with the canvas.

This is equivalent to requiring that `edge1` and `edge2` be multiples
of the standard basis vectors $\mathbf i$, $\mathbf j$. That is, the
dot product of `edge1` and `edge2` must be zero and must take one of
the following forms: $a\mathbf i=(a, 0)$ or $a\mathbf j=(0, a)$, where
$a$ is a real number. Generally we will have $-1\le a\le 1$.

To test for these conditions two additional procedures for vectors
have been defined: `len-vec`, which takes a vector, $\mathbf v=(x, y)$
as argument and returns the length of the vector as given by

$$
\lVert \mathbf v\rVert = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (len-vect v)
  (sqrt (+ (square (xcor-vect v))
           (square (ycor-vect v)))))
{% endhighlight %}

`dot-product` takes two vectors as arguments,
$\mathbf v=(x_1,y_1), \mathbf u=(x_2,y_2)$ and returns the dot product
of the two

$$
\mathbf v\cdot \mathbf u = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2
$$

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (dot-product u v)
  (+ (* (xcor-vect u) (xcor-vect v))
     (* (ycor-vect u) (ycor-vect v))))
{% endhighlight %}

The restrictions we place on the frame, means that for a frame with
edges $\mathbf e_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $\mathbf e_2=(x_2,y_2)$ we must have

$$
\begin{align}
&\mathbf e_1\cdot \mathbf e_2 = 0\\\\
&\lVert \mathbf e_1\rVert = \lvert x_1\rvert + \lvert y_2\rvert
\end{align}
$$

where $\lvert a\rvert$ is the absolute value of $a$. In scheme

{% highlight scheme %}
(and (= 0 (dot-product e1 e2))
     (= (len-vect e1)
        (+ (abs (xcor-vect e1))
           (abs (ycor-vect e1)))))
{% endhighlight %}

### Frames and transformations
Unfortunately Gimp/Script-Fu does not have structures analogous to
frames that can be used to manipulate images, but instead, has
provided procedures such as `gimp-image-scale`, `gimp-image-flip` and
`gimp-image-rotate`. So to define painters we need to do the reverse
of what we have been doing in SICP: that is, instead of expressing
image transformations through frame manipulations, we need to
determine the transformations that have been applied to produce a
given frame.

For example, painters need to recognize that the following frame
means that no transformations to the image need to be performed;

{% highlight scheme %}
(make-frame
  (make-vect 0 0)
  (make-vect 1 0)
  (make-vect 0 1))
{% endhighlight %}

![Untransformed frame]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PictureLanguage_eg01.png)

and that the following frame means that the image needs to be scale so
as to fit the bottom left-hand quarter of the canvas;

{% highlight scheme %}
(make-frame
  (make-vect 0 0)
  (make-vect 0.5 0)
  (make-vect 0 0.5))
{% endhighlight %}

![Scaled frame]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PictureLanguage_eg02.png)

and that the following frame means that the image needs to be rotated
and flipped.

{% highlight scheme %}
(make-frame
  (make-vect 0 0)
  (make-vect 0 1)
  (make-vect 1 0))
{% endhighlight %}

![Rotated and flipped frame]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PictureLanguage_eg03.png)

It turns out the all the effects of the procedures demonstrated in the
picture language, from `beside` and `below` to `square-limit`, can be
achieved using a combination of scaling, horizontal flips and 90
degree counter-clockwise rotations. Furthermore, each of these
transformations modifies the frame in a unique, identifiable way.

#### Transformation matrices
Let the edges of a frame be the rows of a matrix, so that

$$
E = \begin{pmatrix}
  \mathbf e_1\\\\
  \mathbf e_2
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_1 & y_1\\\\
  x_2 & y_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Then the act of flipping and rotating frames can be represented as
applying a transformation to the edges matrix

$$
t(E) = ET
$$

for some transformation matrix $T$. Furthermore, for a transformation,
we can find the inverse transformation, such that

$$
t^{-1}(t(E)) = ETT^{-1} = E
$$

where $T^{-1}$ is the matrix inverse of $T$.

##### Rotation

To rotate the edges $E$ by $\theta$ radians clockwise, the following
transformation matrix is used:

$$
T_{\mathrm{rot}(\theta)} = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta\\\\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}
$$

In particular, to rotate the frame 90 degrees counter-clockwise

$$
T_{\mathrm{rot}(90)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\\\
-1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

and the inverse transform

$$
T^{-1}_{\mathrm{rot}(90)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\\\
-1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1\\\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Thus, when a frame with edges, $E_R$, that produces an image rotated
$n$ quarter turns counter-clockwise, is supplied to a painter, without
knowing $n$ beforehand we can calculate the correct number of
rotations by counting the number of applications of the inverse
rotation transform before the we result in the identity matrix, that
is

$$
E_RT_{\mathrm{rot}(90)}^{-n} = I
$$

##### Horizontal flip

The transformation matrix used to flip the edges of a frame
horizontally is

$$
T_{\mathrm{hori}} = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0\\\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

and the inverse transformation matrix is the same as the transform,
that is, two horizontal flips will result in an unchanged image.

Next we determine when a frame has been flipped. The figure below
shows a frame that has been flipped horizontally.

![Horizontally flipped frame]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PictureLanguage_eg04.png)

We note that by flipping the frame, the angle from $\mathbf e_1$
and $\mathbf e_2$, measured in the counter-clockwise direction, has
changed. This has the effect of changing the sign/direction of the
cross product of the two edges. That is,

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbf e}_1\times\hat{\mathbf e}_2 &= c\mathbf k\\\\
\hat{\mathbf e}_1'\times\hat{\mathbf e}_2' &= -c\mathbf k
\end{align}
$$
for some $c>0$.

So to determine whether a frame has been flipped we only need to look
at the sign of the cross product of the edges, and since our edges
are multiples of basis vectors this is the same the sign of the
determinant of 2x2 matrix with the edges as rows,

$$
\mathrm{det}\left(\begin{bmatrix}
                    \mathbf e_1\\\\
                    \mathbf e_2
                  \end{bmatrix}\right)
$$

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (det u v)
  (- (* (xcor-vect u) (ycor-vect v))
     (* (ycor-vect u) (xcor-vect v))))
{% endhighlight %}
