#### Exercise 1.14
Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the `count-change`
procedure of Section 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents. What are the
orders of growth of the space and the number of steps used by this
process as the amount to be changed increases.

#### Exercise 1.15
The sine of an angle (in radians) can be computed by making use of
the approximation $\sin x\approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and
the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin x = 3\sin(x/3) - 4\sin^3(x/3) 
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of $\sin$.(For the purposes of
this exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its
magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are
incorporated in the following procedures:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
    (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
        angle
        (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
{% endhighlight %}

1. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is
   evaluated?
2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a
   function of $a$) used by the process generated by this `sine`
   procedure when `(sine a)` is evaluated?

##### Solution
1. The procedure `p` is applied the same numbers of times as the angle
   needs to be divided by 3 before the result is less that 0.1 radians.
   So `p` is applied 5 times in the evaluation of `(sine 12.15)`.
2. From the first part of the exercise we see that `(sine n)` is
   $\Theta(\log n)$ in space and since the procedure is a linear
   recursion the procedure is also $\Theta(\log n)$ in space.
