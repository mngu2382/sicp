Implement the `lookup` procedure for the case where the set of records
is structured as a binary tree, ordered by the numerical values of the
keys.

### Solution

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (lookup given-key set-of-records)
  (cond ((null? set-of-records) false)
        ((equal? given-key (key (entry set-of-records)))
         (entry set-of-records))
        (< given-key (key (entry set-of-records))
         (lookup given-key (left-branch set-of-records)))
        (> given-key (key (entry set-of-records))
         (lookup given-key (right-branch set-of-records)))))
{% endhighlight %}
