## Exercise 2.61

Give an implementation of `adjoin-set` using the ordered
representtation. By analogy with `element-of-set?` show how to take
advantage of the ordering to produce a procedure that requires on the
average about half as many steps as with the unordered representation.

### Solution

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cond ((null? set) (cons x set))
        ((< (car set) x) (cons (car set) (adjoin-set x (cdr set))))
        ((= (car set) x) set)
        (else (cons x set))))
{% endhighlight %}

## Exercise 2.62

Give a $\Theta(n)$ implementation of `union-set` for sets represented
as ordered lists.

### Solution

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (union-set set1 set2)
  (cond ((null? set1) set2)
        ((null? set2) set1)
        ((< (car set1) (car set2))
         (cons (car set1) (union-set (cdr set1) set2)))
        ((> (car set1) (car set2))
         (cons (car set2) (union-set set1 (cdr set2))))
        ((= (car set1) (car set2))
         (cons (car set1) (union-set (cdr set1) (cdr set2))))))
{% endhighlight %}
