## Exercise 2.59

Implement the `union-set` operation for the unordered-list
representation of sets.

### Solution

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (union-set set1 set2)
  (cond ((null? set1) set2)
        ((not (element-of-set? (car set1) set2))
         (cons (car set1)
              (union-set (cdr set1) set2)))
        (else (union-set (cdr set1) set2))))
{% endhighlight %}

## Exercise 2.60

We specified that a set would be represented as a list with no
duplicates. For instance, the set {1, 2, 3} could be represented as
the list `(2 3 2 1 3 2 2)`. Design procedures `element-of set?`,
`adjoin-set`, `union-set` and `intersection-set` that operate on this
representation. How does the efficiency of each compare with the
corresponding procedure for the non-duplicate representation? Are
there applications for which you would use this representation in
preference of the non-duplicate one?
