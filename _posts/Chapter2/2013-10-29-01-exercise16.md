Make changes to the square limit of `wave` by working at each of the
levels of abstraction. In particular:

1. Add some segents to the primitive `wave` painter of
   [Exercise 2.49]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapter2/Chapter2-01-exercise14.html#Ex2.49)
   (to add a smile for example).
2. Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split` (for example, by
   using only one copy of the `up-split` and `right-split` images
   instead of two).
3. Modify the version of `square-limit` that uses `square-of-four` so
   as to assemble the corners in a different pattern. (For example,
   you might make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of
   the square.)
