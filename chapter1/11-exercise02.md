#### Exercise 1.9
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two
positive integers in terms of the procedure `inc`, which
increments its arguments by 1, and `dec`, which decrements is
arguments by 1.

    :::scheme
    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each
procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or
recursive?

##### Solution

The first procedure evolves the following recursive process

    :::scheme
    (+ 4 5)
    (inc (+ 3 5))
    (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
    (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc 6)))
    (inc (inc 7))
    (inc 8)
    9

The second procedure evolves the following iterative process

    :::scheme
    (+ 4 5)
    (+ 3 6)
    (+ 2 7)
    (+ 1 8)
    (+ 0 9)
    9

#### Exercise 1.10
The following procedure computes a mathematical function called
Ackermann's function.

    :::scheme
    (define (A x y)
        (cond ((= y 0) 0)
              ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
              ((= y 1) 2)
              (else (A (- x 1)
                       (A x (- y 1))))))
What are the values of the following expressions?

    :::scheme
    (A 1 10)
    (A 2 4)
    (A 3 3)

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

    :::scheme
    (define (f n) (A 0 n))
    (define (g n) (A 1 n))
    (define (h n) (A 2 n))
    (define (k n) (* 5 n n))
Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed
by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive
integer values of $n$ . For example, `(k n)` computes $5n^2$.

##### Solution
From the definition of `A`, `(f n)` is clearly $2n$.

    :::scheme
    (A 1 10)
    (A 0 (A 1 9))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
    ...
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
    (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
    ...
    (A 0 512)
    ;1024
From the evolution of this process we see that `(g n)` results in
$2^n$

    :::scheme
    (A 2 4)
    (A 1 (A 2 3))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1)))
    (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2))
    (A 1 (A 1 4))
    (A 1 16)
    ;65536
From the evolution of this process we see that `(h n)` results in

$$
\underbrace{2^{2^{2^{\ldots^{2}}}}}_{\text{$n$ times}}
$$
